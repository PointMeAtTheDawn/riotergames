# doofbot

To contribute, you'll want to set the following environment variables:

DOOFDEVMODE=true

DBPASS=<Ask Dawn for password!>

BOTPASS=<Ask Dawn for password!>

Then you can do `docker pull croselius/doofbot:version0.0.7` (or whatever the latest is at that time).

And then you can do `make run`. I should make the pull a make command for simplicity :p. If only shared LastPass folders could be free for the other stuff, they've got a decent CLI this could integrate with. PRs welcome, and feel free to file issues that you want improved.
